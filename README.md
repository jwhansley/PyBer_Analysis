# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to explore how city type impacts total and average fares for both riders and drivers.

## Results

- The Rural city type has the highest average fare per ride at $34,62, as well as the highest average fare per driver at $55.49.  This is $4 and $15 more than the next city type respectively
- However the Rural city type also has the lowest amount of rides and drivers
- Becuse the Urban city type has so many more rides and drivers, this city type produces the highest total fare at $39,854.38

- On a weekly basis the amount of fares by city type stays in consistent order, with the Urban city type seeing the highest volume of fares, often between $2000 and $2500
- Whereas the rural city type consistently sees the lowest volume of fares, between $0 and $1000 

## Summary and Recommendations
1. Because the average fares are so much higher, PyBer should explore increasing the amount of drivers in the rural city type to make sure they're capitalizing on this opportunity
2. Because the average fares are so much lower, Pyber should consider increasing the cost of fares in the urban city type to account for the lower fare trips
3. More data would be needed, but there appears to be lower fare amounts around the holidays.  With this in mind, PyBer should consider a seasonal fare increase to account for these lower trips, incentivize drivers to drive during the holidays, and also give a nice little holiday bonus to the drivers!
